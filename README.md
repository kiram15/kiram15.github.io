Personal Website - Kira Miller 

For the "Become a Full Stack Developer" course on LinkedIn Learning that I am taking, this website is used as a tool to 
apply the new skills I am learning. Currently it only has CSS/HTML, but when I continue on with the course, this website will become more robust. 

To access the website, as well as my contact information, here is the link: https://kiram15.github.io/
